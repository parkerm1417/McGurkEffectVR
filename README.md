# McGurkEffectVR
This repo contains all the code, videos, and Unity prefabs used on the McGurk Effect VR project

The Oculus Integration asset, the Google Resonance Audio asset, and the Sky5X One asset were imported into Unity from the asset store.
The Resources folder located inside the Assets folder should contain all videos that are to be used in the experience and the skybox that the experience should switch to when the audio only section is reached.
Be sure to set any public variables for scripts or components attached to the prefabs in the UnityPrefabs.zip file in this repo.
All videos used in this experiment are located on a google drive and can be accessed from the Videos file in this repo. In the Google Drive is also a text file that lists what audio and video are played as well as the talker number for each video.
The audio files used to dub each video can be found in the Audios.zip file.
